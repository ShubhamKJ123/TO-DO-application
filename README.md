# Feature
* Task Creation: Users can enter new tasks using the provided EditText field and add them to the task list by clicking the "Add" button. This allows users to quickly add tasks to their to-do list.

* Task List Display: The app displays the list of tasks in a ListView, providing a scrollable view of all the tasks. Each task is shown with its corresponding priority indicator and a delete button.

* Priority Indicators: Each task in the list is marked with a priority indicator icon. The priority icon changes based on whether the task is marked as high or low priority, providing visual cues for task prioritization.

* Task Deletion: Users can remove tasks from the list by clicking the delete button associated with each task. This allows for easy management and removal of completed or unnecessary tasks.
